<img style="float: left; border-right: 50px solid transparent; height: 100px;" src="https://www.eiira.se/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/logo.svg"> [Arkus AI](https://arkus.ai/) is a young, vibrant startup team of incredibly innovative and compassionate people who have a desire to help fellow human beings for better health and wellbeing. They apply Artificial Intelligence in the field of clinical genetics and health care. They also have multiple partners in academia.

They have launched service to costumers at [Eiira](https://www.eiira.se/en/). Eiira is a genetic counselling company that helps people understand and counter inherited cancer risk. Their services operate in four steps:
1. Customers collect saliva at home.
2. Customers input personal information in the system.
3. Customers receive their genetic profile. In the case of a high risk, they have the option to consult with a **genetic counsellor** for further guidance.
4. Customers can **stay updated** on the latest risk mapping and preventive measures resulting from new discoveries in genetic science. 

Being a very innovative startup, at Eiira, they want to integrate AI into the last steps of their service. This master thesis project will aim to develop language model-powered tools to support and aid their services.

## Prerequisites
A strong knowledge of Python is required. A general knowledge of language models and how they work is also needed.

This thesis has the flexibility to have a more or less technical focus, therefore, depending on your desired focus the following requirements apply:

* High technical focus:
    1. Required: basic knowledge of PyTorch including experience with the creation, training and evaluation of simple models.
    1. Not required but a plus: familiarity with the Transformer architecture
    1. Not required but a plus: experience with language models
    1. Not required but a plus: experience with fine-tuning different models
    1. Not required but a plus: experience with deploying models
* Low technical focus:
    1. Required: basics of statistics 
    1. Not required but a plus: experience with different prompting techniques/in-context learning
    1. Not required but a plus: experience with running data collection/user studies
