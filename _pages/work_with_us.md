# Open positions
There are currently 3 postdoc positions open at the social robotics lab.

## Postdoctoral position in Trustworthy Human-Robot Interaction

The postdoc position is part of the Horizon Europe SymAware (Symbolic logic framework for situational awareness in mixed autonomy) project, and will be focused on human-in-the-loop design and automation methods for ethical and trustworthy awareness in human-robot interaction. Specific topics of interest include system transparency, human oversight, and fairness in social interaction with autonomous vehicles and multi-drone systems.

*The postdoctoral project will be supervised by Ginevra Castellano and Katie Winkle.*

**Deadline: 24 April 2023**

## Postdoctoral position in Human-Robot Interaction with Focus on Gender-Sensitive Social Robots and Autonomous Agents

The postdoc position is part of the "Gender fairness and gender-sensitive design in social robots and autonomous agents" project, funded by the Department of Information Technology of Uppsala University, and will be focused on developing and evaluating methods for algorithmic fairness and gender-sensitive design to counteract gender biases in social robots and autonomous systems. 

In addition to these research duties, the position will also involve teaching duties (in the area of human-machine interaction) up to 20% of full-time employment. 

*The postdoctoral project will be supervised by Ginevra Castellano and Didem Gürdür Broo.*

**Deadline: 2 May 2023**

## Postdoctoral position in Interactive and Interpretable/Explainable Machine Learning for Human-Robot Interaction

This postdoctoral project brings together human-robot interaction with interactive and interpretable/explainable machine learning in the context of participatory automation - that is developing robots which can be “taught” by a diverse range of users. This approach aims to create contextually, socially appropriate machine behaviour whilst also delivering on EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI.

The main tasks for the postdoc are to:

- Identify, design and implement machine learning system(s) which helps users generate and control the training data from which that system will learn.
- Design and implement visualisations/machine communications that support diverse user understanding of the machine learning process and help identify (e.g. gender) bias within training examples being generated

These systems will be used in projects on "teachable robots" for computing education and expert-taught social robots for health currently being undertaken at the social robotics lab.

The position is focused on the research in the described research project and includes a limited amount of teaching and departmental duties, but no more than 20%.

*The postdoctoral project will be supervised by Katie Winkle (Vi3; Human-Machine Interaction) and David Sumpter (Division of Systems and Control).*

**Deadline: 2 May 2023**
